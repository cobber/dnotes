dnotes
======

    A simple directory specific notes system.

Motivation:
-----------

    Do you have too many 'project directories' where you have been working on
    something, trying something out, but you've since been distracted and no
    longer know exactly where you left off?

    I do. Constantly!

    You could write ReadeMe files and leave reminders to yourself.

    Or you could use dnotes!

    dnotes extends the simple readme text file concept with features like:

        - providing a simple way to automatically display notes whenever I visit a directory
        - keeping track of which project directories I visited, in chronological order
        - provide an overview of which project directories I have and what their purpose is/was

Introduction:
-------------

    To see dnotes at work, download it and make sure it is executable and that it can find perl.
    Now simply create a .dnotes file in the current directory and then run dnotes.
    For example:

        % echo hello world > .dnotes
        % dnotes
        NOTES:
        ======
        hello world

    Very similar to 'cat' you might say, but dnotes will not complain if there
    is no file to read and also goes a step or two further.
    dnotes also records the current directory path and the first line of your
    .dnotes file, so you can get an overview of what you've got going
    on, like this:

        % dnotes ls
        Recently used directories with notes:
        =====================================
        2011-09-01 23:30  /tmp                                           hello world
        2011-09-01 23:15  /Users/steve/Development/Unix/dnotes           dnotes - directory specific notes system
        2011-08-30 23:58  /Users/steve/Development/hacker.org/one_of_us  hacker.org one-of-us challenge

    Now, if you're like me, you will constantly forget to read readme's,
    especially if they are hidden, like .dnotes files are.
    If you create an alias for 'cd' which calls dnotes after changing
    directories, your notes will be displayed automatically as soon as you
    enter the directory, like this:

        % cd /tmp
        NOTES:
        ======
        hello world

        I really should come up with a better 'this is a test' message
        %

    If you then delete your .dnotes file and run dnotes again the entry will
    automatically be removed from the overview:

        % rm .dnotes
        % dnotes
        <no output>
        % dnotes ls
        Recently used directories with notes:
        =====================================
        2011-09-01 23:15  /Users/steve/Development/Unix/dnotes           dnotes - directory specific notes system
        2011-08-30 23:58  /Users/steve/Development/hacker.org/one_of_us  hacker.org one-of-us challenge
